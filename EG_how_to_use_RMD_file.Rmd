RMD Markdown file is like a R Script but w more functionality

   It's all notes unless you specifiy Rcode, this is done in 'chunks'
    can point and click 'insert chunk' or 
    use backticks and r curly brackets to begin chunk, backticks to end.
    Use ECHO = FALSE command inside curly brackets to make code not 
    display in final knit result.
    
   Also can use 'Knit' function (must load library first), this will
    make output as a html file, word doc, pdf. SO, can write out narrative, 
    have command to produce a table, table will show up, write out more             explanation of table, code to produce graph, graph shows up, explain
    graph. Use echo=FALSE in curly brackets to suppress code in Knit result.
    I mean come the fuck on here.

   See directly below, 3 single dashes contain default of output,
    >= 3 equal signs create header, header will come out large on top of 
    whatever output format you specify. Two hashtags makes same header.

   Italics is 1 asterisk, bold is 2 asterisks, put on either side of 
    whatever you want bolded or in italics.
    
   Go to Help dropdown for RMD quick reference guide, has lots of stuff

Speed and Stopping Distances of Cars
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document or RMD. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

Load the mtcars dataframe, look at its structure, show first ten rows.


```{r}
data(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
head(mtcars, 10)
```

Make a graph.
Subset mtcars to only include hp and mpg then plot them
Create sep dataset, display first ten rows

```{r}
cars_hp_mpg <- subset(mtcars, select=c(mpg, hp))

head(cars_hp_mpg,10)

```

Now scatter plot it, note code not displayed thank you 'echo'

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars_hp_mpg)

```

Now use full mtcars dataset, display 
which cars in dataset has mpg >=30 OR hp <60

```{r}
subset(mtcars, mpg>=30 | hp<60)

```

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
